# Various Indoor Training Accessories You Need at Home
Exercise is the physical activity you must do every day to stay fit and fine. It helps you burn calories and stay active throughout the day. People who find it uncomfortable going to the gym can take the help of indoor trainers, which help them burn extra calories in the body and get back in shape in no time. The indoor exercises will need the stationary bicycle, which can be kept in the gym room allocated in the home to carry out the workout whenever you want. Indoor cycling using the bike can be sweaty. There are many indoor trainer accessories available, and a few of them include:

# Sweat Cover
When carrying out rigorous workouts on the bike, it is common for sweat to flow throughout the body. It is not just a few drops, but a lot of sweat streaming down the body ruins the flooring. Therefore, it is not recommended to use a towel; rather, use a sweat cover to absorb the sweat and keep the flooring intact. The sweat cover, which is one of the best indoor trainer accessories, will also protect the bike from corrosion that is caused due to perspiration. It is also essential for you to have a training mat under the bike to keep it in a stationary position without wiggling when pedalling at the brisk pace. 

# Bottle Cage Holder
While doing the exercises for a long time, you would feel thirsty. You need to stay hydrated to continue doing the indoor training exercises for a long time. There should be a bottle to fill the drink or glucose water to sip whenever you feel thirsty. However, there should also be a place where you can keep the bottle handy. Finally, there comes the role of the bottle cage holder. It will hold the bottle rigidly when you hang it to the wall.

# Fan
You can arrange the exercising equipment in the well-ventilated space so that your body does not get overheated. When you start doing the exercises, open the windows or get the cooling fan next to you. The fan will blow you some cool air and keep you fresh. It will make you sweat less and feel better to carry out the exercises for some more time. The fan will be in the position of the cyclistâ€™s body. A few fans come with sensors to sense your heart rate and speed so that they can change the speed accordingly. 

# Trainer Mat
When it is kept on the floor, the indoor trainer makes some annoying noise and causes disturbance to other people in the home, especially when you are using the wheel-on trainer. The rear tire will produce noise. It can also be due to the vibration produced by the trainer. This happens when you place it on the wooden floor. Therefore, you need to use the trainer mat. This absorbs vibration and lets the trainer work quietly. 

# Trainer Bag
If you would like to take the bike trainer when you are travelling or to the training camp, the bag comes into the picture. It helps you carry the trainer with ease, also reducing the possibility of damage. When not in use, you can keep the equipment inside this bag. 

# Wrap Up
Be it the worse weather condition outside, or you do not feel like going to the gym, you can do the workouts right at home with the minimum equipment. Of course, an indoor trainer is a must in every home. However, having this is not enough. Other accessories listed above in the article are needed to carry out the exercises conveniently.
